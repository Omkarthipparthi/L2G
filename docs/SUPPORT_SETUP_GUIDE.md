# Support Setup Guide for Leet2Git

This guide will help you set up support channels for your Chrome extension as required by the Chrome Web Store.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Support is Required

Chrome Web Store **requires** developers to provide:
1. ‚úÖ A support email address
2. ‚úÖ A way for users to contact you
3. ‚úÖ Timely responses to user issues

**Failure to provide support can result in:**
- Extension rejection during review
- Removal from Chrome Web Store
- Negative reviews from frustrated users

---

## üìß Option 1: Dedicated Support Email (Recommended)

### Create a Professional Support Email

**Best Practices:**
- Use a dedicated email for extension support
- Make it easy to remember
- Include your extension name

**Good Examples:**
```
support@yourdomain.com
leet2git@yourdomain.com
help.leet2git@gmail.com
leet2git.support@gmail.com
```

**Bad Examples:**
```
yourpersonalemail@gmail.com (looks unprofessional)
randomname123@hotmail.com (not memorable)
```

### Setup Methods

#### Method A: Gmail (Free, Easy)

1. **Create Gmail Account:**
   - Go to https://accounts.google.com/signup
   - Username: `leet2git.support` or similar
   - Complete setup

2. **Configure:**
   - Enable 2FA for security
   - Set up filters to organize extension emails
   - Create canned responses for common issues
   - Set up email forwarding to your personal email (optional)

3. **Test:**
   - Send yourself a test email
   - Verify you can receive and respond

**Gmail Forwarding Setup (Optional):**
```
Settings ‚Üí Forwarding and POP/IMAP ‚Üí Add forwarding address
‚Üí Enter your personal email ‚Üí Verify
```

#### Method B: Custom Domain Email (Professional)

If you own a domain:

1. **Set up email hosting:**
   - Google Workspace ($6/month)
   - Zoho Mail (Free tier available)
   - Microsoft 365 ($5/month)
   - ProtonMail (Privacy-focused)

2. **Create support alias:**
   ```
   support@yourdomain.com
   leet2git@yourdomain.com
   ```

3. **Forward to your main email or dedicated inbox**

#### Method C: Email Forwarding Service

Use services like:
- **ImprovMX** (Free) - Forward custom domain emails to Gmail
- **ForwardEmail** (Free/Paid) - Email forwarding
- **Mailgun** (Free tier) - Developer email service
